Homework for Module 21 - Neural Networks

This assignment uses machine learning and neural networks to help select funding applicants with the best chances of success in their business ventures. The goal of the assignment was to design a neural network model to acheive higher than 75% accuracy. 

Six models were trained using various degrees of data preperation (column dropping, binner, etc.) and neural network structures. The highest accuracy reached was 71%.
